# Project Summary

## Overview
This project aims to develop smart contracts for a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance system and non-fungible token (NFT) functionalities on the Cardano blockchain. The project includes the implementation of membership management, voting mechanisms, fund allocation, dispute resolution, governance parameter updates for the DAO, as well as NFT minting, ownership transfer, secondary market transactions, royalties, and metadata storage functionalities.


## Features Implemented

### DAO Functionality
- **Membership Management:** Smart contract logic for managing DAO membership.
- **Proposal Submission:** Smart contract for submitting proposals within the DAO.
- **Voting Mechanisms:** Implementation of voting mechanisms for proposal voting.
- **Fund Allocation:** Logic for allocating funds based on voting outcomes.
- **Dispute Resolution:** Smart contract functionality for resolving disputes within the DAO.
- **Governance Parameter Updates:** Mechanism for updating governance parameters within the DAO.

### NFT Functionality
- **NFT Minting:** Smart contract logic for minting NFTs.
- **Ownership Transfer:** Implementation of NFT ownership transfer functionality.
- **Secondary Market Transactions:** Smart contract for facilitating transactions in the secondary market.
- **Royalties:** Logic for paying royalties to NFT creators upon secondary sales.
- **Metadata Storage:** Functionality for storing metadata associated with NFTs.

## Testing
- Comprehensive test cases have been implemented for both DAO governance and NFT functionalities.
- Test cases cover various scenarios, including normal use cases, edge cases, and error conditions.
- Tests ensure the accuracy, security, and robustness of the implemented smart contracts.

## Development Environment
- Plutus Playground or local development environments have been set up for writing and testing smart contracts.
- Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is used as the primary development tool, with tasks configured for building and testing smart contracts.

## Next Steps
- Conduct thorough testing to ensure all functionalities work as expected.
- Perform code reviews and optimizations to enhance efficiency and security.
- Deploy smart contracts to the Cardano blockchain and integrate them into the intended applications.
