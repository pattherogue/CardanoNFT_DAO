# Cardano NFT DAO Project (A NOVM BASED PROJECT)

## Overview
This project aims to develop smart contracts for a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance system and non-fungible token (NFT) functionalities on the Cardano blockchain. The project includes the implementation of membership management, voting mechanisms, fund allocation, dispute resolution, governance parameter updates for the DAO, as well as NFT minting, ownership transfer, secondary market transactions, royalties, and metadata storage functionalities.

## Features Implemented

### DAO Functionality
- **Membership Management:** Smart contract logic for managing DAO membership.
- **Proposal Submission:** Smart contract for submitting proposals within the DAO.
- **Voting Mechanisms:** Implementation of voting mechanisms for proposal voting.
- **Fund Allocation:** Logic for allocating funds based on voting outcomes.
- **Dispute Resolution:** Smart contract functionality for resolving disputes within the DAO.
- **Governance Parameter Updates:** Mechanism for updating governance parameters within the DAO.

### NFT Functionality
- **NFT Minting:** Smart contract logic for minting NFTs.
- **Ownership Transfer:** Implementation of NFT ownership transfer functionality.
- **Secondary Market Transactions:** Smart contract for facilitating transactions in the secondary market.
- **Royalties:** Logic for paying royalties to NFT creators upon secondary sales.
- **Metadata Storage:** Functionality for storing metadata associated with NFTs.

## Development Environment
- Set up Plutus Playground or local development environments for writing and testing smart contracts.
- Utilized Visual Studio Code (VSCode) as the primary development tool, with tasks configured for building and testing smart contracts.

## Frontend Development
- Utilized React.js for building the user interfaces.
- Created mockups and wireframes for the user interfaces, including features for browsing, buying, selling, and trading NFTs, as well as interfaces for interacting with the DAO.
- Implemented reusable components such as buttons, cards, forms, and modals.
- Integrated functionality to interact with the smart contracts deployed on the Cardano blockchain using Web3.js or Ethers.js.
- Managed application state effectively using state management libraries like Redux, MobX, or VueX.
- Fetched relevant data from the blockchain, such as NFT metadata, account balances, and DAO governance information, and displayed it in the user interfaces.
- Set up user authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure access to the platform.
- Optimized frontend code for performance to ensure fast loading times and smooth user experience.
- Thoroughly tested frontend components using unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
- Documented frontend code, including component usage, props, and methods, to facilitate understanding and contribution to the project.

## Testing
- Implemented comprehensive test cases for both DAO governance and NFT functionalities.
- Test cases cover various scenarios, including normal use cases, edge cases, and error conditions.
- Ensured the accuracy, security, and robustness of the implemented smart contracts through testing.

## Next Steps
- Conduct thorough testing to ensure all functionalities work as expected.
- Perform code reviews and optimizations to enhance efficiency and security.
- Deploy smart contracts to the Cardano blockchain and integrate them into the intended applications.

## Instructions to Start the Project

### Prerequisites
1. Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can download and install Node.js from the official website: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

### Setup
1. Clone the project repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

3. Install dependencies for both the frontend and the smart contracts:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

    ```bash
    cd ../contracts
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Frontend
1. Start the frontend development server:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm start
    ```

2. The frontend development server should start running, and your default browser should open automatically with the application running. If not, you can access it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Running Tests
1. Run tests for the smart contracts:

    ```bash
    cd contracts
    npm test
    ```

    This command will execute all the test suites and provide feedback on the test results.

### Building the Frontend for Production
1. To build the frontend for production deployment, run:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run build
    ```

    This command will create a production-ready build of the frontend application in the `build` directory.

### Deploying Smart Contracts
1. Follow the deployment instructions specific to your blockchain platform (e.g., Cardano). This typically involves compiling your smart contracts and deploying them to the blockchain using tools like Plutus or other deployment scripts.

### Contributing
1. If you want to contribute to the project, make sure to fork the repository first, then clone your forked repository to your local machine. After making changes, submit a pull request to the main repository for review.

### Feedback and Support
1. If you encounter any issues or have feedback on the project, please open an issue in the project repository or reach out to the project team for support.

For any questions or further information, please refer to the project documentation or contact the project team.
